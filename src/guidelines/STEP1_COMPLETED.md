# Step 1 Complete: Centralized Game State Management

## What Was Implemented

### 1. TypeScript Interfaces (`src/types/game.ts`)
- **Card**: `{ rank: Rank, suit: Suit }` with proper poker card types
- **Player**: `{ id, name, chips, isReady, bets }` with betting tracking
- **Hand**: `{ id, name, label, cards, pot, isDarkHorse }` for the 5 game hands
- **Board**: `{ flop, turn?, river? }` for community cards
- **GameRound**: Union type for the 4 game phases
- **GameState**: Complete application state interface
- **ToastMessage & ChatMessage**: UI notification types
- **GameConfig**: Configurable game parameters

### 2. Game Logic Utilities (`src/utils/gameLogic.ts`)
- **Card ranking system**: Basic hand evaluation (simplified for MVP)
- **Betting validation**: Chip amount, hand selection, and balance checks
- **Round progression**: Logic for advancing between game phases
- **Payout calculation**: Winner determination and pot distribution
- **Mock data generation**: Development data that matches component expectations

### 3. Zustand Store (`src/store/gameStore.ts`)
- **Centralized state**: All game data in one location
- **Actions**: Methods for updating game state (betting, ready, round advancement)
- **Computed values**: Derived state like `canReady()` and `getPlayerChips()`
- **DevTools integration**: Redux DevTools support for debugging
- **Type safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces

### 4. Custom Hooks (`src/hooks/useGameTimer.ts`)
- **Timer management**: Automatic countdown and round progression
- **Effect cleanup**: Proper cleanup of timers and intervals
- **State synchronization**: Timer state updates trigger game logic

### 5. Refactored App.tsx
- **Removed mock data**: All local state replaced with store
- **Simplified logic**: Component now focuses on UI, not business logic
- **Store integration**: Uses `useGameStore()` hook for all state access
- **Event handlers**: Delegates to store actions instead of local state

## Key Benefits Achieved

### ✅ **Single Source of Truth**
- All game state managed in one place
- No more prop drilling or state synchronization issues
- Consistent data across all components

### ✅ **Type Safety**
- Full TypeScript coverage for all game entities
- Compile-time error checking for state mutations
- IntelliSense support for all store actions

### ✅ **Maintainability**
- Clear separation of concerns (UI vs. business logic)
- Easy to add new features or modify existing ones
- Predictable state update patterns

### ✅ **Developer Experience**
- Redux DevTools integration for debugging
- Comprehensive test coverage structure
- Clear action/state patterns

## What's Ready for Step 2

The foundation is now in place for:
1. **Backend Integration**: Store actions can easily be connected to WebSocket events
2. **Real-time Updates**: State updates can trigger UI re-renders automatically
3. **Multiplayer Logic**: Player actions are centralized and can be synchronized
4. **Game Flow**: Round progression and betting logic is implemented

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `src/types/game.ts` - TypeScript interfaces
- `src/utils/gameLogic.ts` - Game logic utilities
- `src/store/gameStore.ts` - Zustand store
- `src/hooks/useGameTimer.ts` - Timer hook
- `src/store/__tests__/gameStore.test.ts` - Test coverage

### Modified Files:
- `src/App.tsx` - Refactored to use store
- `package.json` - Added Zustand dependency

## Next Steps

The centralized state management is complete and working. The next phase will focus on:
1. Setting up WebSocket server infrastructure
2. Implementing room management (create/join/leave)
3. Adding real-time synchronization between players
4. Handling player disconnections and reconnections

The current implementation provides a solid foundation that makes these next steps much more straightforward.
